before running the algorithm check these:

    -XES files in the "input" folder
    -output folder empty
    -having java installed
    -having python installed
    -having these python modules installed: "pyclustering" "pandas" "numpy" e "sklearn" (through pip install is ok)

In the main directory, execute the command "java -jar ReACMe.jar" through any CLI. (windows' prompt or powershell is ok)

In the run, some parameters are asked, representing scores. You may leave them by default.

If everything went right, you have in the output folder:

     -Brief of the clusterization with lables and silhouette
     -dissimilarity matrix used in the calculation
